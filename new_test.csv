Interpretation

Interpretation
The CDKN2A gene encodes multiple proteins, including the tumor
suppressor pl6INK4a (also known as Mtsl), which plays a vital role in cell
cycle Gl checkpoint regulation and is an inhibitor of Cdk4 activity.
CDKN2A also encodes pl4ARF, which regulates p53 by interacting with
Mdm2 [278,232,279].Because the CDKN2A and CDKN2B gene products
encode proteins that act as tumor suppressors, deletion or loss of activity
may result in deregulation of the pl6INK4a/Cdk4/Cyclin/Rb and/or the
Mdm2/p53 pathways, and altered regulation of the cell cycle [72, 279].
Interpretation
KRAS is an oncogene that encodes K-Ras, a member of the Ras family of
membrane proteins that bind GDP/GTP and possess GTPase activity
Activation of Ras signaling causes cell growth, differentiation, and survival
human malignancies, with high incidences in pancreatic, colorectal, and
Iung cancers [65, 84, 64].",,,
